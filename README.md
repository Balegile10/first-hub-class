# First Hub Project
Hey! I am Balegile Klaas. Uncovering and growing my true and highest self is my great passion.
I am edidently keen to discover my unique and powerful expressions of the self that live deeply inside myslef and the world around me. As I am still navigating through this life, I discovered that no model or system will ever completely explain who I am because yes, I am too complex for that.
Just as standing on a map doesn't transport you to a given location, learning about an element of your personality doesn't suddenly deconstruct you to being only that thing.
The world needs us to all show up, be less consumed in our own egos and infect the social ecosystem with the best ideas and memes possible.
Not only am I a becon of hope, but also I am a becon of light and inspiration to the world that need it the most, and it needs you and I to make it a better place and add more to its uniqueness.
